# TeamProfileGenerator
A Test Driven Development CLI application using Node.js that takes input from the user, in this case a team manager, about employees on a software engineering team. Once the team manager is finished entering in the names, ID's, email's and GitHub profiles the application generates an HTML webpage that displays summaries for each person.
